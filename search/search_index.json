Then key access to woody dusty didint seem to work very long (broke currently). Perhaps key access to individual devices but this doesn't solve tools beeing left all over the place. Perhaps making it easier to put tools away might help as on having better tool organisation so people can see that they aren't there/ put away.</p> <p>16 I think a better induction to the space in general would be helpful. It's obviously a tight knit community and it's a little daunting joining. When I joined I wasn't sure how to buy snacks and I still don't know where I can buy a storage box from the space or how to user the large printer. 19 The committee, or whatever, must be clear about what they want members to volunteer for. Making a sound case with detailed specifics will attract potential volunteers to participate. 24 I'm honestly not sure When we came we would always clean up after ourselves I don't feel we would be good enough to train or participate in events 27 I would suggest regular (quarterly/bi-annually) 'upkeep days' for each section i.e. a call to action for the woodworkers/metalworkers/crafters/etc. to come and have a clear out, clean, rennovation of the woodworking/metalworkering/craftering/etc. space.</p> <p>On such pre-determined date, the space is considered closed for a number of hours and people who use the space are encouraged to come and lend a hand.

Everyone seems so friendly and welcoming, and I was sort of taken aback by how I was treated like it was my space, not like I was borrowing someone else's space.

Also I think there should be more involvement from others with the maintenance of the space rather than just being one or two folks. 5 Safety (electrics, inspections on tools, training) 6 Improving access to inductions on equipment would be great, perhaps finding more members qualified to run inductions would allow them to be run more frequently, making it easier for some people to get in and get trained on equipment that they're interested in. 7 Formalise education 8 Induction and training 9 Inclusion 10 I think maybe segmenting users a but and focusing on what will bring different types of users in and keep them would be good.

While only a token, if done right it could generate commitment (as they are being 'paid') and incentivise people to take on a role. The list of tasks and associated credits could be used to get tasks done. 6 I'm happy to have discovered the hackspace, and quickly made several new friends and interests which I much appreciate. Having extracurricular activities is fantastic and the vast and varied knowledge that can be found amongst the various members of the hackspace is one of the best things about the space, it instills confidence that I will be able to find someone to help if I have a question or am struggling with something in particular. 7 NA 10 It's easy to zero in on problems and I'm sure you hear about them - from the limited experience I've had of being involved in running charity orgs the Hackspace is an amazing success. That hasn't come about by accident, it's come about because of hard work from people like you guys.</p> <p>I'm tremendously grateful, basically. 11 You're doing good things! And going through all this feedback must be a lot of work, go nap. 15 Keep up the good work 16 I am grateful I've found the space and I do think you guys do a great job. I do hope to get involved more and feel more part of the community! 19 I can see that the space is constantly improving bit by bit, so with the current committee, keep up the good work. 24 When we came we were made to feel welcome We woz triggered while there and that made it very difficult for me to muster up the courage to come back if it was for another female member at the time (who left the area so left the space) I don't know how I would have got through that day she kept messaging me until I woz calm enough to be able to leave and sorted the help required at</p> <p><pre><code>'Member's Survey 2019'</code></pre> <pre><code>the time (and helped with the trigger)</code></pre> <pre><code>We have rarely been back since as I'm kind of scared</code></pre> <pre><code>I also don't know if we're really welcome and If another person or the\nsame person would cause another trigger</code></pre> <pre><code>32 The volunteers @ hacman work really hard, thank you!

I attach details of what is proposed. It will considerably enhance the appearance of the property. \u00a0 Whilst your current lease doesn\u2019t expire until 30th April 2016 our client has asked us to enter into negotiations with you now for a new lease. We can confirm that our client is willing to grant you a new lease for a further period of three years from 1st May 2016 at the rent of \u00a39,750 plus VAT per annum. This works out at about \u00a310 per square foot which is the going rate for accommodation of this nature in the area. Your current is \u00a37,800 plus VAT per annum. \u00a0 It is also intended that folloing the refurbishment, the landlord will arrange for the cleaning of the communal areas on a regular basis. The cost of this will be recoverable via a service charge. The annual charge for your property will be an additional \u00a31,000 plus VAT per year. This will also include the costs of communal area electricity and fire alarm/emergency lighting testing and maintenance. This will be charged from the December quarter day. \u00a0 I would be happy to meet with you at the property to discuss the matter if you wish. \u00a0 I look forward to hearing from you. \u00a0 Regards, \u00a0 Ian</p> <p>TK - er\u2026 no</p> <p>KR - \u00a31200/49 = \u00a325 pw</p> <p>BC - It'd basically be \u00a31075 per month rent</p> <p>TK - Still no.

The downsides to this approach are:</p> <ul> <li>The need to modify the nginx config every time a website is added or removed.</li> <li>The need to restart nginx after each config modification, causing a short downtime for every websites.</li> <li>The need to expose a port of each container to the host, and therefore keep track of the used ports (two containers can not use the same port).</li> </ul> <p>To avoid these downsides, the magic <code>[**jwilder/nginx-proxy**](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)</code> automates the creation of nginx configs and reloads the proxy server when a container starts and stops. And it has HTTPS support.</p> <p>Even better, the nginx-proxy has a <code>[**LetsEncrypt companion**](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion)</code>, which allows the automatic creation and renewal of HTTPS certificates.</p> <p>In one word: set-it-and-forget-it.</p>"},{"location":"infrastructure/nginx/#project-structure","title":"Project structure","text":"<p>Create a  <code>nginx-proxy</code>  directory next to the websites directories.

Bob 2014-06-23 Took out FFC and cut off / replaced the end of it at gantry end to get X axis moving again. Re-crimped endstop connector at LAOS end because crimping was rubbish. Bob 2014-06-26 FFC connector had failed - Replaced FFC entirely with ribbon cable and adaptor boards designed for CNC machine. Should be a lot more sturdy, but is currently ziptied to base of X axis motor until I think of a better plan. Might design specific board for it. Bob 2014-07-17 Trained Tas + Ruth in Laser Maintenance, Did full clean and re-align of laser Bob 2014-07-23 X axis was stalling out due to insufficient current. Increased the amount available to both X and Y Axis motors Bob 2014-07-28 Changed PWM Minimum to 20/255 instead of 40/255 to prevent charring on engrave. Tas 2014-10-26 Upgraded firmware to laoslaser-26-10-2014.bin - should fix engraving errors where the end of a line gets a little line on it. Bob 2014-11-09 X axis stepper driver was overheating. Turned down current slightly, ziptied fan pointing to it. Ordered DRV8825 based stepper drivers to replace. Full clean and realign. Bob + Tas 2014-11-15 Drilled the X axis offset spacers to 2.5mm, tapped to M3, to replace the m2.5 screws that sheared off. Levelled bed and dropped it a bit to correct focus. Bob + Tas 2014-11-25 Replaced X axis opto endstop with microswitch. Fuck opto endstops. Bob 2014-11-29 Reduced cutting speed &amp; belt tension to stop stall out on fast moves. Realigned and Relevelled Bob + Tas 2014-12-12 Swapped out stepper driver on X axis, changed config to double steps/m (32 microsteps instead of 16), adjusted stepper driver power. Tas 2014-12-12 Built new cable to test stepper directly from driver. Still had issue. Switched around drivers, still had issue. Tested motor separately with no belt, X axis motor is fucked. Replaced Motor, restored original stepper driver + config, halfed steps/m because new motor goes twice as far per step. Rebuilt and did basic realign. Still needs full realign. Wept. Bob 2014-01-31 Replaced tube, rebuilt and cleaned X-Y axes, added new mechanical endstop to Y axis to replace shitty opto flag. Replaced feet with rubber feet. Bob 2015-02-21 Tightened X axis belt to reduce wobble. Bob 2015-02-21 Unkinked coolant tube - laser is now at full power. Bob 2015-03-04 Replaced mirror that had EXPLODED! Bob 2015-03-11 Replaced grub screw that had fallen out of carriage. Chris 2015-03-14 Changed microstepping on X and steps/mm value to be the same as Y - makes motion far smoother. Cleaned bed because it was setting on fire. Bob 2015-03-22 Remounted pump to hang from cable ties, reducing vibration passed on to frame &amp; laser. Ruth 2015-03-29 Cleaned lens on X end, showed Simon D how to do it as he's making a lot of rubber stamps. Bob 2015-07-28 reattached the x axis drive belt and adjusted the location of the air assist. Tas 2015-07-30 Installed new mirror and set alignment. Chris 2015-08-16 Replaced the pump with a new one. It is far quieter. Yay.

We have a small etch tank and all of the equipment available at HacMan for your PCB making needs! If you would like a tutorial please ask Alex for a demonstration\u2026</p> <p>Let the instruction begin! To make a PCB you will need to obtain the following items:</p> <ul> <li>1x piece of copper clad FR4 PCB material</li> </ul> <p>It needs to be slightly larger than the total area of the design you intend to make. Single and double sided FR4 PCB material is available in the PCB equipment box which is next to the electronics bench in the \u2018great wall of storage\u2019. If there is nothing of suitable size for your design you will have to buy your own PCB material.</p> <p> PCB.jpg <ul> <li>Some glossy paper for transferring the design - 120 GSM glossy     paper, matt one side, smooth on the other \u2013 This is available in the     stationery draw in the main part of the space next to the boxes of     shame and the craft making kit. Grab an A4 sheet and prepare the     laser printer. Make sure no one is printing before you press print!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>A clothes iron or a plastic film laminator - There is an iron and a     laminator in the PCB equipment box. Either can be used to transfer     the toner from the glossy paper to the FR4 PCB material</li> </ul> <p> Iron.jpg <ul> <li>The etch tank! \u2013 This is available on the \u2018great wall of storage\u2019 at     the end next to the electronics page. Carry it over to a free space     in the workshop. It will need to be near an electrical socket.     Please be careful and try not to spill the etch fluid. You will also     need to grab the air pump.</li> </ul> <p> Tank.jpg <ul> <li>Finally some latex or rubber gloves, some eye protection goggles a     lab coat or work clothes and some plastic tweezers - These should     all be available in the PPE box in the great wall of storage of in     the PCB making equipment box.</li> </ul> <p> <p>Once you have obtained all of these things the process can begin...Exciting times!</p> <p>1. Load a laser printer (it has to be a laser printer) with 120 GSM glossy paper. Make sure the smooth side is the side that is presented to the toner ink. Print out the PCB layout with only the tracks, pads and dimensions present. Most people in the space use EagleCad to develop their PCBS. It doesn't matter which software you use - Be sure the printout is mirrored before you begin. Remove any excess paper after printing using scissors. These are available in the knives box next to the boxes of shame on the 'great wall of storage'</p> <p> and ready for transfer.jpg <p>2. Once you have the printout on glossy paper its time to get hold of the blank copper clad PCB material. Cut it to size using the bandsaw or the PCB guillotine. I prefer to use the bandsaw. Clean the copper using a polishing block or pencil eraser. The copper area needs to be cleaned to remove any excess dirt or grease. At this point I wear plastic or latex gloves to prevent finger prints. You could also use wire wool - the process is to remove any dirt, grease and oxidation from the surface of the copper.</p> <p> <p>3. Heat up the clothes iron to as hot as possible - make sure there is no water in the iron (if its a steam iron). Place the printed PCB layout toner side down onto the cleaned copper side of the PCB. If needed secure the printout in place using masking tape or box clips. I use an old piece of wood to press down on when I iron on the design. The heat causes the toner to transfer from the paper onto the PCB; About 5 minutes of ironing should see the design properly transferred. Practice makes perfect!</p> <p> <p>4. Once you are happy the design has been transferred turn off the iron and place the PCB into some cold tap water. Be aware the PCB is probably quite hot so use suitable heat protective gloves or tongs! You could just leave the PCB to cool but I'm impatient! Next soak the paper off the PCB exposing just the ink and the copper. I like to use an old toothbrush to clean off the excess paper.</p> <p> paper rubbed off.jpg <p>5. Once complete inspect your transfer. You should be able to read any text present and there should be no broken tracks. If there are broken tracks you can touch them up using an acid resistant marker pen like the permanent markers used for writing on acetate sheets. If the design didn't transfer well at all you can clean off the toner and repeat the process from step 3 onwards. Again practice makes perfect and this is why I prefer the toner transfer method. I can rectify mistakes early on.</p> <p>6. Now it's time to etch the PCB using the ferric chloride. Place the PCB in the etch tank with the design facing up! Gently rock and agitate the etchant for about ten minutes. Using plastic tweezers or taking care roll the etch tank to one side so that you can see the design. See if the uncovered copper has been removed. If it hasn't continue agitating the solution until it has been completely removed.</p> <p> <p>7. Once all of the uncovered copper has been removed take the PCB out of the etch tank and clean the PCB in tap water. Once all of the ferric chloride has been removed, clean off the black toner using wire wool or something suitably abrasive. You should be left with something similar to the picture below. After that it's time to drill any holes required using the dremel and the correct drill bit sizes before populating your PCB with components and soldering it up. Hopefully if it was designed properly it will perform the function you require!</p> <p> and drilled.jpg"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Music/","title":"Music","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Music/#music","title":"Music","text":"<p>Date: Feb/March 2011 Attendance: 20-30 people</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Music/#kits-price-points","title":"Kits &amp; Price points","text":"<ul> <li>Stylophone \u00a35</li> <li>Drawdio \u00a35</li> <li>Auduino \u00a310</li> <li>Theramin \u00a310-15</li> <li>Midi Orchestra</li> </ul>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Music/#other-activities","title":"Other Activities","text":"<ul> <li>Circuit Bending</li> </ul> <p>Category:Workshops</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/","title":"Online Resources","text":"<p>This is a page of useful learning resources online.</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#hardware","title":"Hardware","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#machine-tools","title":"Machine Tools","text":"<p>MIT have produced a series of videos about using a machine shop:</p> <ul> <li>Machine Shop #1</li> <li>Machine Shop #2</li> <li>Machine Shop #3</li> <li>Machine Shop #4</li> <li>Machine Shop #5</li> <li>Machine Shop #6</li> <li>Machine Shop #7</li> <li>Machine Shop #8</li> <li>Machine Shop #9</li> <li>Machine Shop #10</li> </ul>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#soldering","title":"Soldering","text":"<p>How to solder</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#welding","title":"Welding","text":"<p>Arc Welding Basics</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#cnc-machining-and-casting","title":"CNC Machining and Casting","text":"<p>Guerrilla guide to CNC machining, mold making, and resin casting</p> <p>How to make machinable wax (Leeds Hackspace)</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#software","title":"Software","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#arduino","title":"Arduino","text":"<p>Arduino tutorials</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#misc","title":"Misc","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/Online_Resources/#glue","title":"Glue","text":"<p>What glue to use</p> <p>Category:Guides</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/OpenSCAD/","title":"OpenSCAD","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/OpenSCAD/#2d","title":"2D","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Howtos/OpenSCAD/#my-first-design-with-openscad","title":"My First Design with OpenSCAD","text":"<p>Let's look at a simple example using OpenSCAD.

The control loop for the temperature cycle would be a feedback system based upon 0.5 second sampling of two 10k N-type thermistors; one mounted on the Al heating plate and the other on or near the sample carrier.

Since v0.4, LAOS has this connector onboard, so the ribbon cable can just be plugged straight in.</p> <p>(photo)</p> <p>To connect the laser itself, only two lines are needed, one to the 'laser fire' header, and the other to replace the potentiometer for power level. The way LAOS recommend to do the PWM is fucking dangerous for the K40, as they install a pullup on the 5V line, meaning if the cutter is powered and the LAOS board isnt, the laser is on.

PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction and a Thermocycler is a device that cycles heat! In order to multiply DNA strands samples need to be heated to 950C, then cooled to 580C and then reheated to 780C. There are commercial PCR machines available but they are expensive! We think we can do better!! We are looking at realizing an arduino controlled Thermocycler with 4 modules (three heating sections and one cooling section) which automatically performs the heat cycling required on 16 DNA samples. The samples will be provided in test tubes or eppendorfs??</p> <p>The device, once realised might look something like the attached diagram: </p> <p>For the control electronics an arduino Mega 2560 might be appropriate running on 5 Volts with a high current 12V 100W supply for the heater plate(s). The T0220 resistor can be controlled by a PWM fed N-type FET transistor. The control loop for the temperature cycle would be a feedback system based upon 0.5 second sampling of two 10k N-type thermistors; one mounted on the Al heating plate and the other on or near the sample carrier. The temperature of each plate can be displayed on a 16x2 LCD display. The unit will be controlled locally via push buttons and pre-stored temperature cycles or via a control program on a USB connected computer.</p> <p>Useful Part Numbers:</p> <p>Farnell \u2013 9566961 - VISHAY SFERNICE - LTO030F2R200JTE3 - RESISTOR, 30W 2R2 5%</p> <p>Farnell \u2013 1848688 - ARDUINO - A000047 - BOARD, ARDUINO, MEGA2560</p> <p>Farnell \u2013 1672366 - AVX - ND03N00103K-- - THERMISTOR, NTC, 10K, 3.5MM</p> <p>Farnell \u2013 1813384 - INTERNATIONAL RECTIFIER - AUIRF1010Z - MOSFET, N CH, 55V, 94A, TO220AB</p> <p>Useful Websites:</p> <p>http://www.scq.ubc.ca/diy-pcr-notes-appendum-shooting-the-breeze-whatever/</p> <p>http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/labs/extraction/howto/DNA_Extraction.pdf</p> <p>http://www.synbio.org.uk/hardware/diy-lab-equipment.html</p> <p>http://www.instructables.com/id/Coffee-Cup-PCR-Thermocycler-costing-under-350/?ALLSTEPS</p> <p>Category:Madlab projects</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Project_a_Sketch/","title":"Project a Sketch","text":"<p>[ Hardware | Electronics | Software ]</p> <p>The Project-A-Sketch is a giant Etch-A-Sketch!</p> <p>The object itself was originally built by Bob for the 'MadLab Playhouse' area at Playspace 2010.

This made the legs removable, to make it easier to transport.</p> <p>The knobs were built next, two CNCed MDF circles were center-drilled, and had a channel cut into them to allow an M8 hex-head bolt head to be held in place. Acrylic washers and Skate bearings were used to make sure the knobs could spin freely in the holes cut for them.</p> <p>Next, we had to attach the knobs to some encoders. The quadrature encoders used were low resolution, at only 16 notches per rotation, so Bob laser cut a 16 tooth gear to fit on the quadrature encoder, and a second, 64 tooth one to attach to the knob itself. Raiding the scrap bin for more chunks of acrylic, he also cut out a frame to hold all the gears in place. This gives a 1:4 gear ratio, for each turn of the knob, the quadrature encoder outputs 64 state changes, a far more acceptable resolution.</p> <p>The screen was made from a piece of cotton sheeting we found at the madlab, which was thin and white enough to allow rear projection.</p> <p>Category:Project-A-Sketch</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Quadcopter/Electronics/","title":"Electronics","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Quadcopter/Electronics/#motors-controllers","title":"Motors &amp; Controllers","text":"<ul> <li>5x |Hacker Style Brushless Outrunner     20-22L</li> <li>5x Plush 18amp Speed     Controller</li> </ul>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Quadcopter/Electronics/#batteries","title":"Batteries","text":"<ul> <li>3x Flightmax 4000mAh 3S1P     20C</li> <li>1x Accucel-6 50W 5A     Balancer/Charger</li> </ul>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Quadcopter/Electronics/#electronics-boards","title":"Electronics Boards","text":"<ul> <li>1x Arduino Duemilenove ATMega328</li> <li>1x Arduino Protoshield purchased - by parag0n</li> <li>1x 6DOF IMU purchased - by parag0n</li> </ul> <p>Category:Quadcopters</p>"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Quadcopter/Hardware/","title":"v1","text":""},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Projects/Quadcopter/Hardware/#chassis-spec","title":"Chassis Spec","text":"<ul> <li>4 Arms<ul> <li>13mm\u00d710mm aluminium (cheap-ish from B&amp;Q): Can run wires inside.
